## Description
_____________________
DSA(Data Structures & Algorithms) is a simple project created to serve as practice for myself and proof of work for others.
	<br />
	The goal will be to write a program that contains any seemingly important data structure or algorithm that I may find beneficial
	to work on. Hopefully this will expand to a visualized project with a responsive application front end and UI and/or web access.
	<br />
	Each individual structure and algorithm will be listed here and my motivation and thoughts on the process will be added to each section
	as they are completed.
	<br />
Important updates and notes will also be found here as neccessary:

### Data Structures
Stack and queue use the same Node object for implementation.
______________________
#### Stack
Standard stack implementation with a single head node that reference the next node in the form of a linked list. 
Stack contains pop and push functions to add and remove from the stack, along with a peek function for viewing.
#### Queue
Standard Queue structure, a head and tail node in the form of a doubly linked list.
Contains functions for queuing and dequeuing, along with peeking at the top of the queue.
