# Description
_____________________
DSA(Data Structures & Algorithms) is a simple project created to serve as practice for myself and proof of work for others.
	<br />
	The goal will be to write a program that contains any seemingly important data structure or algorithm that I may find beneficial
	to work on. Hopefully this will expand to a visualized project with a responsive application front end and UI and/or web access.
	<br />
	Each individual structure and algorithm will be listed here and my motivation and thoughts on the process will be added to each section
	as they are completed.
	<br />
Important updates and notes will also be found here as neccessary:

## Data Structures
- Stack and queue use the same Node object for implementation, normally the stack would not be a doubly linked list.
- A majority of these structures will require algorithms to complete their inserts/retreivals. So 
  they will be incomplete until those are finished as well.
- Dynamic Array is an unsorted array with O(N) insert/delete operations
______________________
### Stack
Standard stack implementation with a single head node that reference the next node in the form of a linked list. 
Stack contains pop and push functions to add and remove from the stack, along with a peek function for viewing.
### Queue
Standard Queue structure, a head and tail node in the form of a doubly linked list.
Contains functions for queuing and dequeuing, along with peeking at the top of the queue.
### Dynamic Array
Basic Array structure which will use c++ new/delete and pointers to create an array that can increase
and decrease in size as needed.
### Binary search tree
Basic implementation of core functions and leaf node for a  binary search tree. Includes left/right access to leafs
and currently incomplete insert/delete functions
### Red/Black Tree
Created tree and leaf class for a red/black sorting tree. Leaf contains left/right nodes along with a set color of 
red(0) or black(1)
